## Amazon Connect Integration for VoiceBase

This Quick Start configures a set of AWS resources to provide a seamless integration between Amazon Connect and VoiceBase in a few easy steps.

VoiceBase provides APIs for cloud-based speech analytics that enable Amazon Connect users to surface valuable insights from their contact center by ingesting recordings, and transcribing and analyzing call data. This Quick Start integration powers agent QA, agent training, sales and customer service optimization, compliance monitoring, and sensitive data scrubbing (PCI, PII, SSN) from your calls.
